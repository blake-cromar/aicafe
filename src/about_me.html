            Hello, I'm Blake, a machine learning engineer and mathematician currently based in Norway.
        </p>
        <p>
            My childhood fascination with mathematics led me to excel in algebra, trigonometry, and calculus, earning exceptional marks. Mathematics, with its ability to elegantly optimize real-world problems, fascinated me as an art form â€” abstract yet capable of reshaping the world.
        </p>
            In college, I immersed myself in statistics, probability, multivariate calculus, linear algebra, and differential equations. Exploring potential career paths, I discovered a passion for C++, finding its abstract nature akin to mathematics, enabling me to construct innovative systems. This dual interest sparked my journey into both mathematics and software development, where I delved into algorithms, data structures, and object-oriented programming. Formal education in machine learning cemented my career path, merging algorithmic and mathematical thinking seamlessly. Implementing my first machine learning algorithm confirmed that this field would be my lifelong pursuit.
        <p>
            Post-college, I gained valuable experience at HCMI, Lineage Logistics, The United States Air Force, and NEXRO. Highlights include developing a computer vision object-detection algorithm, a deep-learning forecasting model, and enhancing a scheduling optimizer engine.
        </p>
